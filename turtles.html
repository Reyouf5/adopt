      <h5 class="w3-center">Nutrients they need</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Foods and nutrients they need can be very complex, but the general
 feature of these animals in their food is that they contain a lot
 of dietary fiber in exchange for small amounts of proteins,
 fats and sugars.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">you should avoid feeding the turtle with any type of legume (such as beans,
 chickpeas, and peas).  The proper food for turtles is green leaves and
 flowers, as this is their natural food in the wild, and care must be
 taken not to give  them any kind of vegetables, fruits or human food.</p>

      <h4>Caring for turtles</h4>

Turtles are often exposed to serious health problems and die for a short life when 
humans acquire them as pets. Animals that are animals towards environmental conditions are
 a climate zone that differs from their original environment that may put their lives With 
 great danger, and maintaining her health may be difficult.

      <h4>Lighting and heating</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Turtles need about 14 hours of light and heat every day.
 If it is not possible to do this from sunlight, artificial 
 cage lights can be used. If they are kept in particularly 
 cold weather or in an unheated house, it may be very important to provide heating for them.</p><br>
