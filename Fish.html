      <p class="w3-large">small portions </h2>
<p>Feed the fish in small portions. While many people hear that fish require
a tiny amount of chips per eating, giving the fish a large amount of food
 causes  digestion problems or makes the tank dirty and unhealthy.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Type of food:
Whatever type of dry food is used, just put the amount of food the 
fish may eat for 3-5 minutes.  If you place a large amount of food in 
the sink, remove it using a thin mesh.</p>

      <h4>The place of the basin</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">THe are a set of steps and rules that must be taken into account when choosing the
 place where the aquarium will be placed, so that its location is suitable for the living
 conditions that fish need, such as the aquarium near the source of the water, so that
 it can be filled easily and quickly, in addition to the need to keep it away from 
 sunlight , Reaching the sun is enough for fish for only an hour
.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Choose a sink</h4>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Many think that a trough is the best, but this idea is wrong because
 a trough is more prone to dirt and disease spread among fish.</p><br>
