 Dry dog ​​food has the advantage of being lower in<br>
price than other types and can be kept without cooling for long periods.<br></p>

 Although this type of dog food is available in stores<br>
and grocery stores, it is considered very expensive compared to other types of dog food.<br></p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Obedience Training for Dogs</h1><br>
      <h5 class="w3-center">The Behavior:</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Some training methods use punishment, like leash corrections and scolding, to discourage dogs
 from doing everything except what you want them to do. Other methods cut right to the chase and 
 focus on teaching dogs what you do want them to do. While both tactics can work, the latter is 
 usually the more effective approach, and it’s also much more enjoyable for you and your dog. 
 For example, you can easily use treats, games and praise to teach your dog to sit when people 
 approach during walks in the neighborhood. If your dog is sitting, she won’t be dragging you 
 toward the people, jumping up when they get close enough, mouthing on their arms and legs, and 
 so on. That’s pretty efficient training-no pain or intimidation needed. Alternatively, you could 
 grab your dog’s leash and jerk her to the ground every time she jumps up to greet people.</p>
